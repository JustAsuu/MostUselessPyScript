wantednumb = 100

-- da code

currentnum = 1
Isthereyet = False

while Isthereyet == false:
  local newnumb = randint(1, wantednumb * 1.5)
  if currentnumb == wantednumb:
    print("Woah it actually happened and you just ran this and wasted time of your life gg")
    Isthereyet = true
  elseif currentnum - newnum < 0:
    print("too less")
    currentnum += newnum
  elseif currentnumb + newnumb > wantednumb * 2:
    print("Too much")
    currentnum += -newnumb
